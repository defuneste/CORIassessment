# Senior Data Engineer Assessment

Use this assessment to demonstrate your ability to write clean code and your approach to problem solving.

If anything is unclear, please reach out to one of our team members. Asking questions will not affect how we score you on the assessment.

## Data files

In the `data` folder, there are three files:

1) `tab20_tract20_tract10_natl.txt`

This file is the 2020 census tract to 2010 census tract relationship file. You can find an [explanation of the relationship file here](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/rel2020/tract/explanation_tab20_tract20_tract10.pdf).

2) `census_tract_populations_2010.csv`  

This file provides population counts for 2010 census tracts.

3) `census_tract_populations_2020.csv`

This file provides population counts for 2020 census tracts.


## Instructions  

To begin, clone this repository.

Using the provided files, we would like you to analyze the tract relationship changes between 2010 and 2020 and provide a brief report summarizing what you found.

This exercise is designed to be open-ended and there is no right answer.
